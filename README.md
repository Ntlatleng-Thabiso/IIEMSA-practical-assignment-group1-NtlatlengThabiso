Libraries often find it challenging to oversee extensive collections of books and periodicals with manual processes, which are susceptible to mistakes, prolonged, and unproductive. Personnel encounter obstacles in monitoring stock, swiftly finding resources, and producing records. To overcome these issues, a computerized Library Management System was developed. The system enables the addition of books and periodicals, searching resources by identification number, and producing current reports, while remaining simple to operate and upkeep.
The application employs object-oriented concepts, featuring a primary Resource class and specific Book and Periodical subtypes, ensuring a lucid and adaptable structure. Resources are kept in a dynamic array, and a basic menu-based interface using conditional statements supports user actions. This independent organization permits subsequent improvements, such as patron or loan administration, while also solidifying essential programming ideas like inheritance, encapsulation, and array handling.
